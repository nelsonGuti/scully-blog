## ng update

Angular's powerful CLI provides the `ng update` command to perform a basic update to the current stable release of the core framework and CLI.

```bash
ng update @angular/core @angular/cli
```

Angular recommends to update to the latest patch version, as it contains fixes released since the initial major release, The following command
would take you to the latest 15.x.x version and use that to update

```bash
ng update @angular/core@^15 @angular/cli@^15
```

To update to the next beta or pre-release version, use the `--next` option

```bash
ng update @angular/core @angular/cli --next
```
